index.test31=What is HAH
index.test32=Smart contract is the basic building block of Hash Ahead application. They are computer programs stored on the blockchain that allow us to convert traditional contracts into digital parallel. Smart contracts are very logical - follow the if this then that structure. This means that their behavior is exactly the same as programming and cannot be changed.
index.test33=Write
index.test34=Smart contract
index.test35=Their behavior is completely consistent with programming and cannot be changed.
index.test36=Smart contract realizes the digitization of the agreement by converting the agreement terms into computer code, which is automatically executed when the contract terms are met.
index.test37=Automatic execution
index.test38=Predictable results
index.test39=Public records
index.test40=When the contract conditions are realized, the results will be executed automatically without waiting for manual execution results.
index.test41=The smart contract eliminates the possibility of different interpretations. The smart contract will be executed accurately according to the conditions written in the contract code.
index.test42=Smart contracts can also be used for auditing and tracking. As the hash ahead smart contract is located on the public blockchain, anyone can immediately track asset transfer and other relevant information.
index.test43=Privacy protection
index.test44=Because Hash Ahead is an anonymous network (your transaction is publicly bound to a unique encrypted address, not your identity), you can protect your privacy from the influence of observers.
index.test45=Smart contract use case
index.test46=Smart contracts are computer programs that exist on blockchains and can be executed automatically.
index.test47=You can track their transactions, predict their behavior, and even use them anonymously
index.test48=Smart contracts can basically do anything other computer programs can do. They can perform calculations, store data, cast NFTs, send communications, and even generate graphics.
index.test49=Developer
index.test50=Use <br/> times
index.test51=Reward
index.test52=Smart contract award
index.test53=Guarantee the income of the contract author
index.test54=The management mechanism of the contract library ensures the income of the contract author and stimulates the enthusiasm of developing and constructing the underlying contract, so as to quickly improve the ecology of the contract and provide a solid foundation for the application of the upper meta universe.
index.test55=Call convenience
index.test56=Improve the efficiency of application developers and quickly prosper the ecosystem. The decentralized audit mechanism ensures the smooth implementation of these rules and the development interface specification of the underlying contract.
index.test57=Protect the benefits of developers

index.test59=Ensure the sound development of smart contracts
index.test60=Ensure the income of developers, improve the efficiency of developers, and lay a good foundation for the birth of blockchain applications.
index.test61=Improve the efficiency of application developers, <br/> quickly prosper the ecosystem
index.test62=About smart contract Library
index.test63=The system introduces the concept of smart contract library. Although smart contract library has been used in eth ecology for a long time, the authors of many contract libraries have paid their intelligence and actually did not get benefits. The gas cost generated by invoking the contract belongs to the miners, and the contract operators contribute silently in the whole ecology, The model of hash ahead ecology can really make the contract author and the blocker benefit together. In order to improve the security of the contract, the contract review mechanism is added. Under the management mechanism of Dao, the submitted contract can be reviewed by the community before it can be called by the system Therefore, the author of the contract is also required to pay an audit fee when submitting the contract. For erc20 in eth, there are too many identical contracts running in the system. Their codes are the same, but the initialization parameters are different, which also brings great data duplication to the chain and reduces the storage efficiency of the chain. In hash ahead system, only one identical contract will be audited, It greatly reduces the burden of the system When the contract is called, the gas fee spent is given to the account of the contract author in a certain proportion.
index.test64=In order to improve the efficiency of application developers and quickly prosper the ecosystem, the basic system will provide the developer’s SDK, and the contract developers of the underlying library will also develop according to the development rules of hash ahead. The decentralized audit mechanism ensures the smooth implementation of these rules. The development interface specification of the underlying contract, and the system will provide a general SDK to complete the call to all contracts, Reduce the learning cost of developers In order to facilitate the joining of various developers, the SDK provides node, python, go and other language versions.
index.test65=Programmer enthusiasm
index.test66=The management mechanism of the contract library ensures the income of the contract author and stimulates the enthusiasm of developing and constructing the underlying contract, so as to quickly improve the ecology of the contract and provide a solid foundation for the application of the upper meta universe.
index.test67=Punishment for malicious nodes: 1. Lock the voting token of the malicious node and the token of the voter of the malicious node for three months (the verification and proposal nodes have minimum voting requirements). 2. The malicious node address will never be able to participate in the verifier qualification. 3. At the end of the lock-in period, all the voting tokens of the malicious node will be transferred to the black hole address, and 10% of the voter’s tokens will be transferred to the black hole address.

index.test172=Creating nodes requires mortgage hah, and each transaction has a handling fee.
index.test173=Node permissions
index.test174=Anyone has the opportunity to set up a node on the main chain of hash ahead.
index.test175=Our main chain
index.test176=Whether the blockchain can resist tampering is determined by its consensus algorithm. The security of the Hash Ahead main chain is guaranteed by the interaction between thousands of independent nodes managed by individuals and miners around the world.
index.test177=A consensus is generated once every 10 minutes on the main chain, which greatly reduces the consensus data and ensures the safe and stable operation of the main chain. Up to 1000 proponents can be voted. The blocks under the same consensus will be produced by successful campaign proponents in turn. The verifier generated by consensus is used to verify whether the proposer implements according to the specified rules. If it does not implement according to the specified rules, it will start the punishment mechanism to ensure the stable operation of the whole ecology.
index.test178=The creation node needs to mortgage a certain amount of HAH, which is related to the call expansion rate. When you trade in your wallet, each transaction will charge a certain handling fee to prevent users from trading with each other, resulting in a sharp increase in transaction volume.
index.test179=Anyone has the opportunity to set up a node on the main chain of Hash Ahead. At the same time, you can also download and optimize the super node, but this step will not give you financial benefits.
index.test180=Why develop on the main chain of Hash Ahead

index.test203=On the premise that the sub chain maintains efficient operation and ensures safety, more and more enterprises and users choose Hash Ahead.
index.test204=The fastest block speed of the sub chain is 100ms. With the support of the sub chain, the TPS of the whole ecosystem can reach the order of hundreds of thousands per second.
index.test205=Sub chain security
index.test206=With the more and more extensive application of blockchain, the Hash Ahead protocol itself has become more secure to resist various forms of attacks.
index.test207=Why do users choose Hash Ahead sub chain?
index.test208=As of today, the sub chain of Hash Ahead is unmatched in speed, which can ensure the safety of users to the greatest extent while ensuring efficiency.
index.test209=The sub chain is created by transactions on the main chain. The parameters of the main chain can be specified during creation. The fastest speed of sub chains is 10ms, and the number of sub chains can be arbitrary. With the support of sub chains, TPS of the whole ecosystem can reach the order of hundreds of thousands per second.
index.test210=Hash Ahead also needs to be safer. Common progress has been made in attack discovery and defense, security authentication, secure domain name, trust infrastructure establishment, secure communication and data secure storage. With the emergence of more and more blockchain applications, the protocol itself also needs to become more secure to resist Vera’s various forms of attacks.
